Hi Everyone!

My name is Brandy. I am a sophmore at UH Manoa, majoring in Accounting. However, I am still conflicted about my major and am considering triple majoring in Accounting, Finance, and MIS.
I love boba, I love computer science, and I love making money through reselling online or through trading stocks and options.
